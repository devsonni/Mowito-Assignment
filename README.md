- Detection_Script (main) was created in google colab for detection algorithm, clone this repository and change directory in main script for invoking trained models in script. Trained models are saved in /Trained-Model.    
- All dependecies installation code is mentioned in colab script. Moreover, each line of code has it's own comment for understanding usage of each line.    

## Results
- **Task 1**: The output should contain the **value of barcode**, and how many times every barcode appears in the image ( there could be repetitions of the barcode). This output could be printed ✅
